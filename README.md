# DSCI 525 Project Group19
This repo is used for DSCI 525 Web and Cloud Computing project.
# Overview
In this project, we will perform prediction on `Daily rainfall over NSW, Australia` from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). Our goal is to build and deploy cloud-based ensemble machine learning model for predicting future rainfall in Australia. We will gather data from web using API, processing and deploying the model for others to use for their own analysis.
