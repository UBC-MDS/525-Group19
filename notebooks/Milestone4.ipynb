After this experience, we were ready to move on to more sophisticated methods of working with big data! \n",

We used the AWS user interface by setting up our own EC2 instance and S3 bucket, and connected to the cloud from our local terminal.  We also prepared the data to be used in our ML model in the next milestone. \n",

We used spark's MLlib to identify the best hyperparameters.  Then trained our ML model with this hyperparameters and saved the trained model to S3. \n",
